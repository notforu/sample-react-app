# Sample React App

This is a simple application, which is supposed to demonstrate, how I develop React-driven apps.
It contains configured boilerplate - Webpack + React + Redux + Saga + React-Router.

The functionality is pretty simple:
- Authorization in Github (through OAuth).
- Display logged user repos.
- When user clicks on some repo, he is navigated to it's contributors.
- When user clicks on some contributor's name, he is navigated to his repos.

To run project locally, you should clone this repo, and run `npm i && npm start` in your command line.

Also app is deployed on free hosting, and you can [see how it works](https://sample-react-app.000webhostapp.com/).
